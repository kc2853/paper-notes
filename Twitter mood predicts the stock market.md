# Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2010, Bollen et al.)

## Background
* While Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) and random walk theory refer to how stock prices are largely driven by *new* information (i.e. news) which are unpredictable, EMH is losing its relevance, as multiple types of alternative data (e.g. online chat activity, Google search queries, blog sentiments, etc.) have indeed been used to make meaningful predictions.
* Indirect sources of public mood: results of soccer games, weather conditions
* Rise of Twitter

## How tweets were analyzed
* OpinionFinder (OF): binary value signifying positive vs negative mood
* Google Profile of Mood States (GPOMS): 6-dimensional value comprising Calm, Alert, Sure, Vital, Kind, Happy
* Hence a total of 7 dimensions were considered per tweet
* Feb. 28 - Dec. 19 of 2008: 9,853,498 tweets posted by 2.7 million users
* Removed: punctuations, uppercase, spam (if links detected)

## How association was measured
* Daily closing values of Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)
* Two

# Data Breaches, Phishing, or Malware? Understanding the Risks of Stolen Credentials (2017, Thomas et al.)

## Notes
* 3 means of credential stealing: 1. data breach (and subsequent selling on blackmarket forums, etc.); 2. phishing kits (emails and websites impersonating legitimate brands); and 3. keyloggers
* Data breach: 1.9 billion usernames and passwords exposed
* Phishing kits: 12.4 million victims
* Keyloggers: 788,000 victims
* 7% to 25% of exposed passwords match a victim's Google account
* Time period: from March 2016 to March 2017

## Comments
* True owners recover access within 250 days (but only 10% within a month)
* 2FA recommended, as keylogging is least exposed to risk compared to data breaches and phishing attacks
* Possible to gain information on attackers by analyzing exfiltration emails (i.e. emails they use to retrieve stolen credentials)
* Can study and filter for those exfiltration emails
* Most phishing kits and keyloggers are "unpopular" (i.e. at most 470 exfiltration points -- for HawkEye at $35 -- per variant)
